# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Types of Machine Learning

By using different classification \(FYI: this is an category for machine learning!\) criteria, we could divide types of machine learning into the following groups:

* Supervised vs. Unsupervised
* Classification vs. Regression

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised

#### Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is where you have both the input and output variables, and Unsupervised Learning is where you only have the input data and no corresponding output data.

In supervised learning, you use an algorithm to learn a mapping function from the input to the output: $$Y=f(x)$$ . With the mapping function, you will be able to approximately predict the output variables for new input data that do not exists in the training dataset.

It is called _Supervised_ learning because we know the correct output of input data, and thus, our algorithms are able to correct the predictions on the training data. The process of this kind of machine learning is like a teacher supervising the process.

For supervised learning, there are some general steps to solve the given problem.

* Determine the type of training data. Before doing anything else, you need to decide what kind of data is to be used as a training set.
* Prepare the training set, validation set and test set.
* Determine the input feature representation of the learned function.
* Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm.
* Complete the design.
* Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function.

#### Unsupervised Learning

Controversially, the goal for unsupervised learning is to learn more about the data itself, by model the structure or distribution of the data. There is no correct outputs, and therefore we are unable to correct the algorithms and predictions. In other words, algorithms are left to their own devises to discover the structure of the data.
