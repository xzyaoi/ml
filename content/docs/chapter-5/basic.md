# AutoML Introduction

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the process of machine learning. In the previous chapters, we know that a typical machine learning application include several steps, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization and much more. It is difficult and sometimes impossible to make machine learning applications by hands, and many of these steps are beyond the abilities of non-experts, AutoML is proposed to automating the process. 

# Automating Target

* Automated Data Preparation and Ingestion.
* Automated Feature Engineering.
* Automated Model Selection
* Automated Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO).
