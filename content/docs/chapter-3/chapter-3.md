# Chapter III Fundamentals of Deep Learning

### What is neural network?

When we are talking about neural networks, we are actually talking about artificial neural networks (ANNs). As the name suggests, it is a type of machine learning algorithm that models itself after the human brain. A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, similiar to the neurons in our human brain.

### What is perceptron? What is multi-layer perception machine, a.k.a MLP?

Perceptron is a kind of linear classifier  for two classes. The input of the Perceptron is a
